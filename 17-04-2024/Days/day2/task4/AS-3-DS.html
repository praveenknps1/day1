        Bruce Lee was a martial artist, actor, and cultural icon renowned for
        his martial arts skills, charisma, and philosophy. He revolutionized the
        portrayal of Asians in Hollywood and popularized martial arts worldwide
        through his films, most notably "Enter the Dragon." Born in San
        Francisco and raised in Hong Kong, Lee developed his own martial art
        philosophy called Jeet Kune Do, emphasizing efficiency, directness, and
        personal expression. His influence extended beyond martial arts into
        areas like fitness, philosophy, and pop culture. Despite his untimely
        death at age 32, Bruce Lee's legacy remains influential, inspiring
