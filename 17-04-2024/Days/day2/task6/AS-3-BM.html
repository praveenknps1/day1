            <h2>Chapter-1</h2>
            <p>
                 
I
was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island
town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras state. My
father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education
nor much wealth;
despite these disadvantages, he possessed great
innate wisdom and a true generosity of spirit. He had an
ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recal the
exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite
certain that far more outsiders ate with us than al the
members of our own family put together.
My parents were widely regarded as an ideal couple.
My mother’s lineage was the more distinguished, one of
her forebears having been bestowed the title of ‘Bahadur’
by the British.
I was one of many children—a short boy with rather
undistinguished looks, born to tal and handsome parents.
We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the
middle of the 19th century. It was a fairly large pucca house,
made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in
Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid al
inessential comforts and luxuries. However, al necessities
were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In
fact, I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both
materia ly and emotionaly.
I normaly ate with my mother, sitting on the floor of the
kitchen. She would place a banana leaf before me, on
which she then ladled rice and aromatic sambhar, a variety
of sharp, home-made pickles and a dolop of fresh coconut
chutney.
The famous Shiva temple, which made Rameswaram
so sacred to pilgrims, was about a ten-minute walk from
our house. Our locality was predominantly Muslim, but there
were quite a few Hindu families too, living amicably with
their Muslim neighbours. There was a very old mosque in
our locality where my father would take me for evening
prayers. I had not the faintest idea of the meaning of the
Arabic prayers chanted, but I was totaly convinced that they
reached God. When my father came out of the mosque
after the prayers, people of different religions would be
sitting outside, waiting for him. Many of them offered bowls
of water to my father who would dip his fingertips in them
and say a prayer. This water was then carried home for
invalids. I also remember people visiting our home to offer
thanks after being cured. My father always smiled and
asked them to thank Alah, the benevolent and merciful.
The high priest of Rameswaram temple, Pakshi
Lakshmana Sastry, was a very close friend of my father’s.
One of the most vivid memories of my early childhood is of
the two men, each in his traditional attire, discussing
spiritual matters. When I was old enough to ask questions, I
asked my father about the relevance of prayer. My father
told me there was nothing mysterious about prayer. Rather,
prayer made possible a communion of the spirit between
people. “When you pray,” he said, “you transcend your body
and become a part of the cosmos, which knows no division
of wealth, age, caste, or creed.”
My father could convey complex spiritual concepts in
very simple, downto-earth Tamil. He once told me, “In his
own time, in his own place, in what he realy is, and in the
stage he has reached—good or bad—every human being
is a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine
Being. So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings and
problems? When troubles come, try to understand the
relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents
opportunities for introspection.”
“Why don’t you say this to the people who come to you
for help and advice?” I asked my father. He put his hands
on my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes. For quite
some time he said nothing, as if he was judging my
capacity to comprehend his words. Then he answered in a
low, deep voice. His answer fi led me with a strange energy
and enthusiasm:
Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as a
natural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever
they are in trouble, they look for someone to help them.
Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to
show them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing,
and desire finds its own special helper. For the people who
come to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effort
to propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.
This is not a correct approach at al and should never be
fo lowed. One must understand the difference between a
fear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us
to seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves.
I remember my father starting his day at 4 a.m. by
reading the namaz before dawn. After the namaz, he used
to walk down to a smal coconut grove we owned, about 4
miles from our home. He would return, with about a dozen
coconuts tied together thrown over his shoulder, and only
then would he have his breakfast. This remained his routine
even when he was in his late sixties.
I have throughout my life tried to emulate my father in my
own world of science and technology. I have endeavoured
to understand the fundamental truths revealed to me by my
father, and feel convinced that there exists a divine power
that can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and
failure, and guide one to one’s true place. And once an
individual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is
on the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.
I was about six years old when my father embarked on
the project of building a wooden sailboat to take pilgrims
from Rameswaram to Dhanuskodi, (also caled
Sethukkarai), and back. He worked at building the boat on
the seashore, with the help of a relative, Ahmed Jalaluddin,
who later married my sister, Zohara. I watched the boat
take shape. The wooden hul and bulkheads were
seasoned with the heat from wood fires. My father was
doing good business with the boat when, one day, a
cyclone bringing winds of over 100 miles per hour carried
away our boat, along with some of the landmass of
Sethukkarai. The Pamban Bridge colapsed with a train ful
of passengers on it. Until then, I had only seen the beauty of
the sea, now its uncontrolable energy came as a revelation
to me.

            <p>

 Once I settled down at the Schwartz High School,
 Ramanathapuram, the enthusiastic fifteen-year-old within
 me re-emerged. My teacher, Iyadurai Solomon, was an
 ideal
 guide for an eager young mind that was yet uncertain of
 the possibilities and alternatives that lay before it. He made
 his students feel very comfortable in class with his warm
 and open-minded attitude. He used to say that a good
 student could learn more from a bad teacher than a poor
 student from even a ski led teacher.
 During my stay at Ramanathapuram, my relationship
 with him grew beyond that of teacher and pupil. In his
 company, I learnt that one could exercise enormous
 influence over the events of one’s own life. Iyadurai
 Solomon used to say, “To succeed in life and achieve
 results, you must understand and master three mighty
 forces— desire, belief, and expectation.” Iyadurai Solomon,
 who later became a Reverend, taught me that before
 anything I wanted could happen, I had to desire it intensely
 and be absolutely certain it would happen. To take an
 example from my own life, I had been fascinated by the
 mysteries of the sky and the flight of birds from early
 childhood. I used to watch cranes and seaguls soar into
 flight and longed to fly. Simple, provincial boy though I was, I
 was convinced that one day I, too, would soar up into the
 skies. Indeed, I was the first child from Rameswaram to fly.
 Iyadurai Solomon was a great teacher because he
 insti led in al the children a sense of their own worth.
 Solomon raised my self-esteem to a high point and
 convinced me, the son of parents who had not had the
 benefits of education, that I too could aspire to become
 whatever I wished. “With faith, you can change your
 destiny,” he would say.
 One day, when I was in the fourth form, my mathematics
 teacher, Ramakrishna Iyer, was teaching another class.
 Inadvertently, I wandered into that classroom and in the
 manner of an old-fashioned despot, Ramakrishna Iyer
 caught me by the neck and caned me in front of the whole
 class. Many months later, when I scored ful marks in
 mathematics, he narrated the incident to the entire school
 at morning assembly. “Whomsoever I cane becomes a
 great man! Take my word, this boy is going to bring glory to
 his school and to his teachers.” His praise quite made up
 for the earlier humiliation!
 By the time I completed my education at Schwartz, I was
 a selfconfident boy determined to succeed. The decision to
 go in for further education was taken without a second
 thought. To us, in those days, the awareness of the
 possibilities for a professional education did not exist;
 higher education simply meant going to colege. The
 nearest colege was at Tiruchchirappali, speled
 Trichinopoly those days, and caled Trichi for short.
 In 1950, I arrived at St. Joseph’s Colege, Trichi, to
 study for the Intermediate examination. I was not a bright
 student in terms of examination grades but, thanks to my
 two buddies back in Rameswaram, I had acquired a
 practical bent of mind.
 Whenever I returned to Rameswaram from Schwartz,
 my elder brother Mustafa Kamal, who ran a provision store
 on the railway station road, would cal me in to give him a
 little help and then vanish for hours together leaving the
shop in my charge. I sold oil, onions, rice and everything
 else. The fastest moving items, I found, were cigarettes and
 bidis. I used to wonder what made poor people smoke
 away their hardearned money. When spared by Mustafa, I
 would be put in charge of his kiosk by my younger brother,
 Kasim Mohammed. There I sold novelties made of
 seashels.
 At St. Joseph’s, I was lucky to find a teacher like the
 Rev. Father TN Sequeira. He taught us English and was
 also our hostel warden. We were about a hundred boys
 living in the three-storeyed hostel building. Rev. Father
 used to visit each boy every night with a Bible in his hand.
 His energy and patience was amazing. He was a very
 considerate person who took care of even the most minute
 requirements of his students. On Deepavali, on his
 instructions, the Brother in charge of the hostel and the
 mess volunteers would visit each room and distribute good
 gingely oil for the ritual bath.
 I stayed on the St. Joseph’s campus for four years and
 shared my room with two others. One was an orthodox
 Iyengar from Srirangam and the other a Syrian Christian
 from Kerala. The three of us had a wonderful time together.
 When I was made secretary of the vegetarian mess during
 my third year in the hostel, we invited the Rector, Rev.
 Father Kalathil, over for lunch one Sunday. Our menu
 included the choicest preparations from our diverse
 backgrounds. The result was rather unexpected, but Rev.
 Father was lavish in his praise of our efforts. We enjoyed
 every moment with Rev. Father Kalathil, who participated in
 our unsophisticated conversation with childlike enthusiasm.

        <h2>Chapter-3</h2>
<p> 
    Through the window of the compartment, I watched the
    countryside slip past. From a distance, the men in the fields
    in their white dhotis and turbans, and the womenfolk in
    bright
    splashes of colour against the green background of
    paddy fields, seemed to inhabit some beautiful painting. I
    sat glued to the window. Almost everywhere, people were
    engaged in some activity which had a rhythm and
    tranqui lity about it—men driving cattle, women fetching
    water from streams. Occasionaly, a child would appear
    and wave at the train.
    It is astonishing how the landscape changes as one
    moves northwards. The rich and fertile plains of the river
    Ganga and its numerous tributaries have invited invasion,
    turmoil, and change. Around 1500 BC, fair-skinned Aryans
    swept in through the mountain passes from the far north
   west. The tenth century brought Muslims, who later mingled
    with the local people and became an integral part of this
    country. One empire gave way to another. Religious
    conquests continued. A l this time, the part of India south of
    the Tropic of Cancer remained largely untouched, safe
    behind the shield of the Vindhya and Satpura mountain
    ranges. The Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, Godavari, and
    Krishna rivers had woven a net of almost unassailable
    protection for the tapering Indian peninsula. To bring me to
    Delhi, my train had crossed al these geographical
    impediments through the power of scientific advancement.
    I halted for a week in Delhi, the city of the great Sufi
    Saint Hazrat Nizamuddin, and appeared for the interview at
    DTD&P(Air). I did wel at the interview. The questions were
    of a routine nature, and did not chalenge my knowledge of
    the subject. Then I proceeded to Dehra Dun for my
    interview at the Air Force Selection Board. At the Selection
    Board, the emphasis was more on “personality” than on
    inte ligence. Perhaps they were looking for physical fitness
    and an articulate manner. I was excited but nervous,
    determined but anxious, confident but tense. I could only
    finish ninth in the batch of 25 examined to select eight
    officers for commissioning in the Air Force. I was deeply
    disappointed. It took me some time to comprehend that the
    opportunity to join the Air Force had just slipped through my
    fingers. I dragged myself out of the Selection Board and
    stood at the edge of a cliff. There was a lake far below. I
    knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were
    questions to be answered and a plan of action to be
    prepared. I trekked down to Rishikesh.
    I bathed in the Ganga and reveled in the purity of its
    water. Then, I walked to the Sivananda Ashram situated a
    little way up the hi l. I could feel intense vibrations when I
    entered. I saw a large number of sadhus seated al around
    in a state of trance. I had read that sadhus were psychic
    people—people who know things intuitively and, in my
    dejected mood, I sought answers to the doubts that
    troubled me.
    I met Swami Sivananda—a man who looked like a
    Buddha, wearing a snow-white dhoti and wooden slippers.
    He had an olive complexion and black, piercing eyes. I was
    struck by his irresistible, almost childlike smile and
    gracious manner. I introduced myself to the Swamiji. My
    Muslim name aroused no reaction in him. Before I could
    speak any further, he inquired about the source of my
   sorrow. He offered no explanation of how he knew that I
    was sad and I did not ask.
    I told him about my unsuccessful attempt to join the
    Indian Air Force and my long-cherished desire to fly. He
    smiled, washing away al my anxiety almost instantly. Then
    he said in a feeble, but very deep voice,
    Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it
    is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic
    energy. This energy is released into the ether each night,
    as the mind fals into the sleep state. Each morning it
    returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic
    currents. That which has been imaged wil surely and
    certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this
    ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the
    eterna ly unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.
    When the student is ready, the teacher wil appear—
    How true! Here was the teacher to show the way to a
    student who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destiny
    and go ahead with your life. You are not destined to
    become an Air Force pilot. What you are destined to
    become is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget
    this failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined
    path. Search, instead, for the true purpose of your
    existence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrender
    yourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.
    I returned to Delhi and enquired at the DTD&P(Air)
    about the outcome of my interview. In response, I was
    handed my appointment letter. I joined the next day as
    Senior Scientific Assistant on a basic salary of Rs 250/
   per month. If this was to be my destiny, I thought, let it be so.
    Fina ly, I was fi led with mental peace. No more did I feel
    any bitterness or resentment at my failure to enter the Air
    Force. Al this was in 1958.
    At the Directorate, I was posted at the Technical Centre
    (Civil Aviation). If I was not flying aeroplanes, I was at least
    helping to make them airworthy. During my first year in the
    Directorate, I carried out a design assignment on
    supersonic target aircraft with the help of the officer-in
   charge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from the
    Director, Dr Neelakantan. To gain shop-floor exposure to
    aircraft maintenance, I was sent to the Aircraft and
    Armament Testing Unit (A&ATU) at Kanpur. At that time,
    they were involved in a tropical evaluation of Gnat Mk I
    aircraft. I participated in the performance assessment of its
    operation systems.
